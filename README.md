## Grading description:
### Planning:
- 70-100% A submission in this mark band represents excellent work. Above 80% you should consider your work to be exceptional, and above 90% your work is exemplary and tending towards perfection. To achieve a mark above 70% you will have integrated and extended the lab work covered in class to offer an excellent level of functionality, both in terms of the number of features and their quality of implementation. Your reports will explain your thinking, in relation to both design and implementation, with clarity . To achieve above 80% then you should be aiming to exceed the taught content of the module and introduce ideas and findings from your self-directed learning.
### Development:
- 60-69% To achieve a mark in this band you will have produced work that is to a very good standard. As a rule, most students will achieve in the mid to upper end of this grade band. This indicates that you are developing significant depth in your understanding of the domain as a whole, as well as significant technical understanding of underlying technologies. You will also be developing reliable critical faculties that enable you to realistically appreciate what you have achieved and how it can be improved.
